                        <h3>What is UB Hacking?</h3>
                        <p>UB Hacking is a 24 hour hackathon hosted at SUNY Buffalo by the UB ACM. It is a hackathon for students by students. We want to see students bring their awesome ideas to reality. UB Hacking will provide meals for the entirety of the hackathon, a place to nap (if you really need to), awesome free swag, and prize money and more!</p>

                        <h3>What is a hackathon?</h3>
                        <p>A hackathon is when people who are excited about programming come together for a weekend and collaborate to build cool things. Entrepreneurs, designers, and developers work in teams to create hacks and apps for web or mobile platforms.

                        <h3>Who can take part?</h3>
                        <p>UB Hacking is a student Hackathon. Therefore, if you are a student at a university or even high-school you can join us. We are open to all majors and years, even if you are a freshman. If you've never been to a hackathon, it's a good time to start, as we are all here to learn. Whether you have a team or not, we encourage anyone who is interested to come and hack for the weekend.</p>

                        <h3>What do I need to bring?</h3>
                        <p>You will of course need to bring your laptop and charger. On top of that, you should probably bring a phone charger. A power strip and a refillable water bottle should be on your list as well. Any hardware you plan to hack with should be brought, and maybe a sweatshirt if you happen to get cold.</p>

                        <p>You are free to sleep if you like, and we will have designated sleeping areas. Plan on bringing a sleeping bag to do so.</p>

                        <p>You have nothing to worry about. We are all here to have fun and learn something new, so feel free to ask questions. Many of us are more than willing to help out.</p>

                        <p>You should come! We will have others like you, or teams looking for more people to join. At the start of the hackathon we have a time set to organize teams. You will definitely find someone to work with. You might also find other hackers in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1428735690705677/" target="_blank">this year's event page</a> on Facebook. You are also free to work alone!</p>

We have lunch, dinner, a late night snack, breakfast and then lunch again. Not only that, but we have all kinds of drinks and caffeine beverages.
